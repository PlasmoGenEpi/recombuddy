\title{Simulate a single sample}
\usage{
sim_sample(k, rho = 7.4e-07, set_props, chrom_sizes = get_chrom_sizes())
}
\arguments{
\item{k}{the number of serial meiosis events.}

\item{rho}{the recombination rate (per-site, per-meiosis). By default uses
the value 7.4e-7 from Miles et al. (2016).}

\item{set_props}{proportions of each of the members of the sample set.
Dictates the probability they are chosen as an ancestor.}

\item{chrom_sizes}{lengths of each chromosome, taken from `get_chrom_sizes()`
by default.}
}
\value{
A list with one element per haploid genome. Within each element is
  another list with three elements; the first two specify whether the
  genotype was copied over without recombination, and if so, which ancestor
  was it copied from. The final element `segments` contains the richest
  information - a tibble giving segments along the genome and which memeber
  of the sample set is ancestral to each segment.
}
\description{
Simulates one or more haploid genotypes within a single sample
  by drawing ancestors from a sample set and applying recombination.
