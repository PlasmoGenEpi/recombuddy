Description: recombuddy is a lightweight genetic simulation toolkit designed to model recombination
    and polyclonality, making it particularly well-suited for Plasmodium analysis. Its
    streamlined simulation framework captures key patterns observed in real data—such as within-sample
    relatedness and mosaic haplotypes—without unnecessary complexity. The package provides core functionality
    for simulating recombination blocks, projecting marker loci onto these genomic patterns, and visualizing
    the resulting allele frequencies and genotype structures.
